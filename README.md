# Signicat Authentication Demo

I've built a React SPA with an ExpressJS backend to create an identification session
and log in with BankID using the Signicat REST API.

Check it out here: http://signicatauthdemo.herokuapp.com/

## 🏁 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You require a set of Signicat credentials setup as environment variables for the backend app to run this demo:

```
CLIENT_ID=<CLIENT_ID_HERE>
CLIENT_SECRET=<CLIENT_SECRET_HERE>
```


## 🔧 Usage

To run the demo, you need to install the dependencies and run the backend app:

```
npm install
npm start
```
